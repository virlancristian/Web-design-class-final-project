## Web Design Project

This is a project assignment I made for my web design class. It consists of a simple website for getting the current forecast, as well as getting a 5 day forecast. To do this I wrote a script in JS which fetches some data from an API and shows it onto the website. It also contains an autofill for the search bar.
